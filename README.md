# SPA Playground

Hello, stranger! This is my personal SPA playground to maintain my knowledge of different single page frameworks.

I've implemented the same "Get Beer" app in Angular, React and Vue. It simply fetches 25 beers from [Punk API](https://punkapi.com/) and shows them on the page. Quite classic take-home exercise material for a technical job interview, isn't it?

> (Sidenote: I'm aware of the issues with BrewDog and I'd rather use something which doesn't depend on their data, but I also want to have a completely public and open API which doesn't require dealing with API keys or authentication.)

I originally created the first version of this playground in late 2017 for educational purposes and I only used Angular. In 2018 I worked in a Vue project so I felt that I'm going to forget all my skills in React. Around that time I added a React version. Since then I've only used React. You get the point, right?

I hope to have enough energy to maintain this repo, improve it and document it to the point that someone else than me might also benefit when they are learning any of these frameworks. Because this is a side project, don't keep your expectations too high!

Cheers,

Timo
