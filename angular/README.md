# Get Beer - Angular edition

This is a simple demo application to showcase how to use Redux state and Effects in Angular 6.

The data api is [Punk APIv2](https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2). It doesn't
currently need any API key, but limits the number of requests to 3600 per hour.

The idea is to implement the same app in Angular, React and Vue to keep my knowledge of these frameworks and libraries up-to-date.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.8.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
