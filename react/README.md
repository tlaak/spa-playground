# Get Beer - React edition

## Introduction

This is a simple demo application to showcase how to build a small React app with TypeScript.

The data api is [Punk APIv2](https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2). It doesn't
currently need any API key, but limits the number of requests to 3600 per hour.

## Monorepo

This app is part of a monorepo where the same app is implemented in different frontend
frameworks and libraries.

## Installation

You'll need [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) package manager to install the dependencies.

Just run `pnpm install -r` anywhere inside this project.

If you wish, you can also use `npm` or `yarn`.
