# Get Beer - React edition

## Disclaimer

I can't be bothered to keep the dependencies up-to-date as this whole app is just as simple showcase and it's using a little bit old fashioned redux and saga based state management and data flow. Use at your own risk!

## Instructions

This is a simple demo application to showcase how to use Redux state and Sagas in React with TypeScript.

The data api is [Punk APIv2](https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2). It doesn't
currently need any API key, but limits the number of requests to 3600 per hour.

The idea is to implement the same app in Angular, React and Vue to keep my knowledge of these frameworks and libraries up-to-date.
